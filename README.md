Machine Learning Coursework
======================================

This repository contains a complete collection of homework and project assignments for the DSCI 552 Machine Learning course, taught by Dr. Mohammad Reza Rajati. The coursework covers a broad range of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, model evaluation, and data preprocessing methods.

Contents:
---------
- Homework 1: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification on the Vertebral Column dataset
- Homework 2: Linear and KNN regression on the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset
- Homework 3-4: Time-series classification using statistical features and logistic regression
- Homework 5: Decision trees, LASSO, Ridge regression, and Boosting on crime and medical data
- Homework 6: Tree-based models and SMOTE applied to imbalanced APS Failure dataset
- Homework 7: Multi-class and multi-label classification using SVM and K-means clustering
- Final Project: Image classification of 20 bird species using transfer learning (EfficientNetB0 and VGG16)
